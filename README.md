# NLP_Project

# Introduction
In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis stands as a crucial task, enabling the extraction of subjective information from text data. This project focuses on classifying tweets based on the emotions they express, such as joy, sadness, fear, and anger. By leveraging a dataset labeled with these emotions, we aim to train and compare various machine learning models to accurately predict the primary sentiment of each tweet. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with a validation set provided at the end to ensure the model's generalizability and to avoid overfitting.

The significance of this project lies in its practical applications across numerous fields, including **customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and public opinion tracking. By analyzing sentiment, organizations can gain insights into user opinions, enhance customer experiences, and make informed decisions.**

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Train and Evaluate Various Models:
- Fully Connected Neural Network: Implement and train a feed-forward neural network to classify tweet emotions.
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Utilize LSTM or GRU-based RNNs to capture sequential dependencies in tweet texts for sentiment classification.
- Transformer Architecture: Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model (We are using BERT based model in our project) using the HuggingFace library to leverage advanced contextual understanding for emotion detection.
